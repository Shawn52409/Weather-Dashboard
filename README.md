# Description
This website was made to give a user a way to search a city and find the current weather of that city which includes the date, weather forecast icon with description, current temperature, wind speed, Humidity and UV index by number and color depending on the level of severity.  Below the current weather the user will find a five day forecast that will show weather forecast icon with description, temperature, wind speed humidity for each of the five days.  The searches will save to local storage and create a button below the search bar.  When clicked on the previous search button the weather for the city displayed in the button will display again.  There is also an included clear history button to remove all previous searches.
